## ‚úÖ RESULT

The gallery now properly showcases the venue first, giving potential clients an immediate visual tour of the property, buildings, and grounds. Wedding photos are still accessible but appropriately categorized as examples rather than the primary content.

Visitors can now:
1. See the venue spaces immediately upon visiting the gallery
2. Browse wedding examples when they're ready
3. View specific aspects (ceremonies, receptions, details) as needed
4. Access all photos if desired

This creates a more professional venue presentation that prioritizes the property showcase while maintaining access to social proof through wedding photography.
